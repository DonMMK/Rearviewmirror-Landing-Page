                Rearviewmirror wasn't built by a startup team or dreamed up in a boardroom. It started as a personal project-a Christmas gift from the app's founder to his girlfriend in 2023. Originally built in Swift, it was a simple app meant just for the two of them-to record their memories, share date ideas, and stay emotionally connected during the ups and downs of life. When friends saw it, they all said the same thing: "Wait... can we have that too?"

                What started as a love letter between two people became something bigger-an app that couples everywhere could use to navigate their relationship's journey together. So he rebuilt it from scratch-for everyone.
